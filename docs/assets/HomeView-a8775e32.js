To be precise, a fan-project based on the book <a href="https://www.datasketch.es/" data-v-2a3af82e>Data Sketches</a>, which was born out of a collaboration between <a href="https://shirleywu.studio/" data-v-2a3af82e>Shirley Wu</a> and <a href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com/" data-v-2a3af82e>Nadieh Bremer</a>, and harbours a collection of data visualizations that are beautiful and immensely inspiring. So inspiring that I decided to take it as a starting point of my own personal journey to get better at data analysis and visualization. </p><p data-v-2a3af82e> My aim is to follow the twelve categories that Shirley and Nadieh chose for Data Sketches, and put my own spin on them: choose a topic and dataset that seems exciting / interesting / worth exploring, try to come up with a fitting visualization, and learn something new in the process. </p><p data-v-2a3af82e> In the links below the visualizations will gradually start to show up (in non-definite order). Some might take very long to finish, some hopefully less so. I might never finish, but for sure I plan to have fun trying! </p></div>',1),B={class:"home-view__content__themes"},z=d({__name:"HomeView",setup(a){const i=["Nostalgia","Music","Presidents & Royals","Movies","Books","Travel","Culture","Nature","Myths and Legends","Community","Olympics","Fearless"],r=["Nostalgia","Music"];return h({title:"Home"}),(L,M)=>{const c=_("RouterLink");return o(),s("main",I,[e("div",N,[x,e("div",C,[V,e("div",B,[(o(),s(p,null,m(i,(t,l)=>v(c,{key:t,class:y(["home-view__content__themes__link",{disabled:!r.includes(t)}]),to:{name:"theme",params:{theme:t.toLowerCase()}}},{default:f(()=>[e("span",null,n(`${l+1}.`),1),w(" "+n(t),1)]),_:2},1032,["class","to"])),64))])])])])}}});const H=k(z,[["__scopeId","data-v-2a3af82e"]]);export{H as default};
