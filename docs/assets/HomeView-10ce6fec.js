To be precise, a fan-project based on the book <a href="https://www.datasketch.es/" data-v-27a55e7a>Data Sketches</a>, which was born out of a collaboration between <a href="https://shirleywu.studio/" data-v-27a55e7a>Shirley Wu</a> and <a href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com/" data-v-27a55e7a>Nadieh Bremer</a>, and harbours a collection of data visualizations that are beautiful and immensely inspiring. So inspiring that I decided to take it as a starting point of my own personal journey to get better at data analysis and visualization. </p><p data-v-27a55e7a> My aim is to follow the twelve categories that Shirley and Nadieh chose for Data Sketches, and put my own spin on them: choose a topic and dataset that seems exciting / interesting / worth exploring, try to come up with a fitting visualization, and learn something new in the process. </p><p data-v-27a55e7a> In the links below the visualizations will gradually start to show up (in non-definite order). Some might take very long to finish, some hopefully less so. I might never finish, but for sure I plan to have fun trying! </p></div>',1),L={class:"home-view__content__themes"},T=p({__name:"HomeView",setup(a){const r=["Nostalgia","Music","Culture","Presidents & Royals","Movies","Books","Travel","Nature","Myths and Legends","Community","Olympics","Fearless"],l=["Nostalgia","Music"];m({title:"Home"});const c=_(!!sessionStorage.getItem("animation-played"));return u(()=>v(()=>{sessionStorage.setItem("animation-played","true")})),(j,D)=>{const d=g("RouterLink");return n(),s("main",{class:o(["home-view",{animate:!c.value}])},[e("div",V,[B,e("div",M,[z,e("div",L,[(n(),s(w,null,f(r,(t,h)=>k(d,{key:t,class:o(["home-view__content__themes__link",{disabled:!l.includes(t)}]),to:{name:"theme",params:{theme:t.toLowerCase().replaceAll("& ","").replaceAll(" ","-")}}},{default:b(()=>[e("span",null,i(`${h+1}.`),1),S(" "+i(t),1)]),_:2},1032,["class","to"])),64))])])])],2)}}});const F=N(T,[["__scopeId","data-v-27a55e7a"]]);export{F as default};
