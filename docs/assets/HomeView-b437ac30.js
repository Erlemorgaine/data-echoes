To be precise, a fan-project based on the book <a href="" data-v-dbf28ae9>Data Sketches</a>, which was born out of a collaboration between <a href="" data-v-dbf28ae9>Shirley Wu</a> and <a href="" data-v-dbf28ae9>Nadieh Bremer</a>, and harbours a collection of data visualizations that are beautiful and immensely inspiring. So inspiring that I decided to take it as a starting point of my own personal journey to get better at data analysis and visualization. </p><p data-v-dbf28ae9> My aim is to follow the twelve categories that Shirley and Nadieh chose for Data Sketches, and put my own spin on them: choose a topic and dataset that seems exciting / interesting / worth exploring, try to come up with a fitting visualization, and learn something new in the process. </p><p data-v-dbf28ae9> In the links below the visualizations will gradually start to show up (in non-definite order). Some might take very long to finish, some hopefully less so. I might never finish, but for sure I plan to have fun trying! </p></div>',1),V={class:"home-view__content__themes"},z=l({__name:"HomeView",setup(a){const i=["Nostalgia"],d=["Nostalgia"];return(B,C)=>{const r=h("RouterLink");return s(),o("main",k,[e("div",S,[I,e("div",x,[N,e("div",V,[(s(),o(_,null,p(i,(t,c)=>f(r,{key:t,class:"home-view__content__themes__link",to:{name:"theme",params:{theme:t.toLowerCase()}},disabled:!d.includes(t)},{default:v(()=>[e("span",null,n(`${c+1}.`),1),u(" "+n(t),1)]),_:2},1032,["to","disabled"])),64))])])])])}}});const L=g(z,[["__scopeId","data-v-dbf28ae9"]]);export{L as default};
