# data-echoes

_Data Echoes_ is a personal and ongoing project to create 12 data visualizations, based on 12 topics, and learn about techniques for data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization in the process. It is heavily inspired by the [Data Sketches](https://datasketch.es) project by Shirley Wu and Nadieh Bremer.

The frontend application containing the final project can be found in the /data-echoes folder. The numbered folders contain the scripts and Jupyter Notebook files used during the preliminary data preparation phase, inasmuch as applicable to the chosen topic.
