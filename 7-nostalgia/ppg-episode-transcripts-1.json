      "Narrator: 'Twas the city of Townsville, and all through the town,",
      "All the townsfolk are stirring as snow's falling down.",
      "It's bitter and freezing in the dead of December,",
      "But there's reason for joy, if you can remember.",
      "For it's this time of year that our story unfolds,",
      "When our hearts are the warmest, despite all the cold.",
      "Yes, it is Christmas, just two days before,",
      "And all through the town, none can wait anymore...",
      "For the timely arrival of one certain fat guy...",
      "Who brings us all goodies from out of the sky.",
      "Full of anticipation are these urban folks,",
      "None more so than the students at old Pokey Oaks.",

      "Buttercup: Well, can it! I'm busy.",
      "Blossom: Doing what?",
      "Buttercup: Writing my wish list for Santa.",
      "Bubbles: Are you crazy? You're only giving him two days to prepare and that's even if he gets it on time!",
      "Buttercup: Oh, yeah? When did you send yours, smarty- pants?",
      "Bubbles: December 26.",
      "Buttercup: Hah! That's after Christmas.",

      "Princess Morebucks: Hah!",
      "Princess: Who would want a stupid old BB gun?",
      "Girls: Princess!",
      "Princess: Besides, you'll shoot your eye out. Since my daddy buys me anything I want, I only have one thing on my list for Santa: to be a Powerpuff Girl!",
      "Blossom: Don't hold your breath, Princess.",
      "Princess: What?! Why?!",
      "Bubbles: Because Santa has his own list, and he checks it twice. It says who's naughty and who's nice.",
      "Princess: So?",
      "Bubbles: Duh! You're naughty.",
      "Princess: Nuh- uh!",

      "Buttercup: You teamed up with three felons and went on a crime spree!",
      "Bubbles: You tricked our friend Robin into stealing, and then you tattled on her!",
      "Blossom: You're a spoiled brat who's greedy and jealous, and you don't care who you step on to get what you want!",
      "Princess: And your point is...?",
      "Blossom: The point, Princess, is that you better change your ways, or all you're ever gonna get from Santa is a big fat lump of coal in your stocking.",
      "Ms. Keane: Okay, kids... ooh! Hold your horses.",
      "Ms. Keane: Bye- bye now. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Be nice for Santa.",
      "Ms. Keane: Remember: he's watching you.",
      "Ms. Keane: Ooh!",

      "Princess: They said I was naughty! Can you believe that?!",
      "Princess: Me?! Naughty?! I'm not naughty, am I?!",
      "Driver: Well, uh... I'll... oops!",

      "Driver: You're- you're- you're breaking up!... I'm going through a... unnel... alk... late...",

      "Nanny: Time for bed! Lights out.",
      "Princess: Wait! I need another pillow!  Fine! I'll just go get it myself!",
      "Princess: Naughty, huh? I'll show you who's naughty!",
      "Princess: And all these years I thought that coal in my stocking came from Daddy's coal mine!",
      "Princess: Who does that blimp think he is, denying me presents?",
      "Princess: Well, this time I am gonna be a Powerpuff Girl!  And I'm sure not gonna let some elf with a weight problem stop me!",
      "Princess: Hah! Well, I'll show him and I'll show those Powerpukes who's naughty and who's nice!",

      "Narrator: Ahh, Professor, get to it. You fix up those lights.",
      "Everything must be perfect on this most happy of nights.",

      "Not candy and presents, but Christmas' demise!",
      "Bubbles: Girls! Girls! Girls! Wake up!  I heard Santa! He's been here!",
      "Bubbles: I know I heard him.",
      "Bubbles: What?  The stockings!",
      "Bubbles: No!",
      "Bubbles: No, no, no, no! Noooo!",
      "Bubbles: WAKE UP!  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!",
      "Buttercup: Yay! Presents! Let's go, baby!",
      "Bubbles: No!",
      "Blossom: Whoo- hoo!",
      "Bubbles: But wait!",
      "Buttercup: What the heck?",
      "Blossom: Santa hasn't even been here yet!",
      "Bubbles: Yeah- huh. I heard reindeer on the roof.",
      "Buttercup: Oh, yeah? Then where are all the presents?",
      "Bubbles: That's what I've been trying to tell you! THERE ARE NO PRESENTS!",
      "Blossom, Buttercup: What?!?",
      "Bubbles: Listen, okay, okay. Me and Octi were dancing with pirates in a pond, when a man in a gorilla suit started yelling. So I woke up, and then I heard Santa on the roof. And I tried to wake you up, but I couldn't, 'cause you wouldn't wake up. So I went down the hallway, and the Professor was snoring... so I came downstairs to see what Santa left... even though I know I'm not supposed to. But there weren't any presents under the tree, just ornaments hanging!  Like that cute little shoveling- snowman one, which is really my favorite because it's funny that a snowman would be shoveling snow, when he's made of snow!  So then I looked in my stocking, but there wasn't candy. Instead, there was coal! Can you believe it? Coal! In my stocking! Which is just ridiculous, 'cause why would Santa give me coal? So I looked in your stockings, and there was coal there too! So I looked next door, and they didn't have any gifts either! Only coal in their stockings, and all the other kids on the block!",
      "Blossom: You went through other kids' stockings?!",
      "Bubbles: No! I saw through the houses. Duh! X- ray vision!",
      "Blossom: Bubbles, you should know better.",
      "Buttercup: No wonder you got coal in your stocking.",
      "Bubbles: I already had coal in my stocking before I looked at the other kids' stockings!",
      "Buttercup: Oh, really? Then why don't me and Blossom have coal in our stockings?",
      "Bubbles: You do!",
      "Blossom: Me?",
      "Buttercup: You gotta be kidding.",
      "Blossom: Really?",
      "Buttercup: Nuh- uh.",
      "Blossom: Buttercup I can understand, but... me?",
      "Buttercup: Hey!",
      "Bubbles: See?",
      "Blossom: This can't be right.",
      "Buttercup: Um... yeah!",
      "Bubbles: It- it was a mistake. He must not have checked his list twice like he's supposed to.",
      "Blossom: We better find Santa and set this straight. Ho...",
      "Bubbles: ho...",
      "Buttercup: ho!",
      "Girls: Let's go!",
      "Princess: Hello, Powerpuffs!  I've come to deliver you your Christmas present: A fourth and more powerful member of your team!",
      "Princess: Me! Princess!",
      "Girls: What?!",
      "Princess: That's right! You can't deny me any longer!  Santa realized that I was the only truly nice kid in the whole world and that you were naughty for not giving me what I want!",
      "Princess: So now every kid in the world gets coal! And I get what I've always deserved: To be a Powerpuff Girl!",
      "Buttercup: This is so wrong!",
      "Blossom: How could Santa believe that Princess is nice?!",
      "Bubbles: Excuse me?! How could Santa believe that I am naughty?!",
      "Buttercup: 'Cause you snooped on other people's presents!",
      "Bubbles: Look. I already told you, I only looked 'cause we didn't have any presents, so I wanted to see if any other kids had any presents.",
      "Blossom: Enough chatter, girls. We better find Santa and fast.",
      "Princess: Oh, no, you don't. I knew you conceited little ingrates wouldn't be able to accept the fact that Santa thinks you're naughty.",
      "Princess: But I'm not gonna let you brats ruin my Christmas.",
      "Buttercup: Forget it, Princess. We're so gonna tell Santa on you!",
      "Princess: Not if I tell on you first.",
      "Bubbles: We didn't do anything?",
      "Princess: Oh, yeah?  'Oh, Santa Claus, as the only nice child in the whole world, I felt it was my duty to warn you about the three naughty girls who were so angry you gave them coal...'  '... that they're coming to destroy your workshop and ruin Christmas forever.'  Oh, Santa...",
      "Buttercup: Bubbles!",
      "Blossom: She'll catch up. We can't let Princess get ahead of us.",
      "Buttercup: Ow! Quit it!  Ow! Quit it!  Ow! Quit it!",
      "Buttercup: QUIT IT!!!",
      "Princess: Thanks, Einstein!",
      "Blossom: Good job, Buttercup.",
      "Bubbles: Yeah, nice one.",
      "Buttercup: Oh, shut up!",
      "Princess: Out of the park!  Two down...",
      "Blossom: Ha! Payback!",
      "Princess: Thanks, Einstein!",
      "Princess: No fair!",
      "Princess: No fair!",
      "Princess: NO FAIR!",
      "Princess: Cool it, girls!",
      "Princess: Hey! How'd you like my stocking stuffer?",
      "Buttercup: Stuff that!  I can't believe that worked.",
      "Narrator: More rapid than eagles, the coursers they came,",
      "And they screamed and they shouted and called each other names.",
      "But in a toymaker's shop way up ahead,",
      "A jolly old elf was filled up with dread.",
      "Narrator: This one Christmas Eve weighed great on his soul,",
      "Back from his night of delivering coal.",
      "Santa: Ho ho ho!  What's with all the crashing and the smashing, and the smashing and the crashing?! Huh?! I'm out delivering coal all night long, and I come home to the Smashing- and- Crashing Gang?!",
      "Bubbles: But-",
      "Santa: Uh- uh! No buts! I ain't listenin' to no buts from some no- good naughty kids! And no no- good little naughty kids are gonna tell me what's what!",
      "Santa: 'Cause guess what?",
      "Santa: ANSWER ME!!!",
      "Blossom: Uh...",
      "Santa: That's right! First time, first time it's ever happened. Every last little no- good, good- for- nothin' kid in the stinkin' world was naughty!",
      "Santa: Naughty! Naughty! Naughty little kids the world over!  Except for one. One nice sweet little girl.",
      "Buttercup: You're wrong!",
      "Santa: Oh, I am, huh?!  Well, I's gots the list, baby.",
      "Santa: Check it!",
      "Princess: Yeah! Check it!",
      "Santa: Yeah! A million bazillion good- for- nothin's on this list!  And one little itty bitty, perfect little angel over here.",
      "Princess: Nyah!",
      "Bubbles: That's not right!  Maybe you didn't check the list twice!",
      "Buttercup: Yeah! Princess is the naughtiest kid ever!",
      "Blossom: She must've snuck up here and switched the lists!",
      "Princess: Nuh- uh!  Santa, don't listen to them! They're just jealous 'cause they got coal.",
      "Princess: They're jealous 'cause I'm nicer, I'm smarter, and I'm prettier, and I'm better than them so they wouldn't let me be a Powerpuff Girl. That makes them naughty!",
      "Santa: You mean, the Powerpuff Girls?  Not the same Powerpuff Girls who are always helping people and saving the day and being really good?  I mean, really good?",
      "Santa: Yeah, yeah. See, that explains all the flying and floating and stuff.",
      "Princess: But I should be a Powerpuff Girl! Me! Not them! Me! My daddy says I'm better! My daddy says I'm the best! And if you're too much of a fatheaded fathead to see that, I'll tell my daddy!",
      "Princess: And he'll come and build a parking lot over this cheap little arts- and- crafts popsicle stand of yours!",
      "Princess: Got it?!",
      "Princess: So, you better give me whatever I want for Christmas.....'cause my daddy says I get whatever I want, whenever I want it! And if that means all of those lousy, worthless, second- rate, bargain- basement brats in the world don't get anything for Christmas, then that's just the way it's gonna have to be!",
      "Princess: 'Cause I am better than them!  And it says so right here!",
      "Princess: So put that in your pipe and smoke it, Santa Clod!",
      "Santa: LIST, SCHMIST!  I don't need no stinkin' list tellin' me who's naughty and who's nice!",
      "Santa: You know why? 'Cause I'm Santa Claus!  Check it! Princess...",
      "Santa: You have gone and worked my last nerve!",
      "Santa: I have no other choice. You are so rotten, so despicable, so naughty... I'm putting you on the...",
      "Santa: Permanent Naughty Plaque!",
      "Santa: Bum- bum- bummm!",
      "Princess: You can't do that!  I'm telling my daddy!",
      "Princess: NO FAIR!",
      "Buttercup: Wow, Santa! We didn't know you could give kids superpowers for Christmas.",
      "Santa: Eh. No one's ever asked.",
      "Blossom: Santa, it's almost morning! What about all the nice children who got coal?",
      "Santa: It's all right, girls. I've pulled rush jobs before. All it takes is...",
      "Bubbles: All those poor boys and girls.",
      "Santa: Hundreds of years of perfect attendance.",
      "Santa: A couple of close calls... but we've always made it. But now... I'm ruined.",
      "Santa: Powerpuff Girls, with your streaks so bright, won't you deliver the Christmas gifts tonight?",
      "Blossom: We'd be honored, Santa, and we'll do our best.",
      "Santa: Good, 'cause my head's killing me.",
      "Narrator: So all 'round the world the Powerpuffs flew,",
      "With a sack full of toys and a giggle or two.",
      "They knew that their job was to fly through the skies...",
      "And deliver the gifts before the sun should arise.",
      "They spoke not a word, but took care of their deed,",
      "Delivering gifts at a breakneck speed.",
      "Narrator: Their streaks ribboned the sky, their swiftness severe.",
      "They'd have sure been the envy of eight certain reindeer.",
      "In and out of all chimneys, each and every abode,",
      "Gift by gift, they completed the task they were bestowed.",
      "Dollies and race cars, horseys, choo- choos, and blocks,",
      "Teddy bears! Puppy dogs!  Underwear and socks.",
      "All these items slipped under every child's tree,",
      "Arranged rather nicely by these super girls three.",
      "Narrator: They were making good time, even though they were rookies,",
      "So they stopped once or twice to have milk and some cookies.",
      "Narrator: Then at last they were done whew! just before dawn.",
      "So they sped back to Townsville, to home with a yawn.",
      "Narrator: They entered their room, for the wear no less worn,",
      "And snuggled into bed to await Christmas morn.",
      "Professor: Girls! Wake up! Wake up!  It's Christmas! It's Christmas!  He came! Santa came!",
      "Professor: Come on, come on! Let's go open the presents, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!  I think somebody might have gotten that new atom splitter they've been eyeing!",
      "Professor: Come on, come on, come on, come on!",
      "Bubbles: Professor, it's too early!",
      "Blossom: We'll open presents later.",
      "Buttercup: Go back to bed!",
      "Bubbles: Wait a minute.",
      "Blossom: What are we saying?",
      "Buttercup: Who cares if we're tired?",
      "Girls: It's Christmas!",
      "Girls: Presents!",
      "Narrator: Now all the nice kids of the world won't get stiffed.",
      "They'll look on with pure joy at every wrapped gift.",
      "So paper's torn open and ribbon unfurls,",
      "'Cause Christmas was saved...",

      "Brian Larsen: The city of Townsville. This is where the Powerpuff Girls live.",
      "Brian: Oh, you might know them as those three cute little girls, saving the day before bedtime. Well, to me, that's not enough. I want to know what makes 'em tick. Where are they from? Where are they going? I want to know everything about them. Yes, the Powerpuff Girls!  What are their hopes and dreams, their desires and aspirations? Do they fight crime all day? Do they set aside a certain portion of it for leisure? How tall are they, and what are their shoe sizes? Where do they sleep, and what do they eat for breakfast? Do they put jam on their toast, or don't they put jam on their toast? And if not, why not? And since when?",
      "Brian: I'm Brian, and this is my documentary. And you're gonna find out firsthand just who those cute little crime- fighters are. So buckle up... this is gonna be a wild ride.",
      "Brian: Sugar... spice... and everything nice.",
      "Brian: Yep, those are pretty normal ingredients, all right. Mix 'em all together, and they pretty much make... mush. But to the city of Townsville, those three special ingredients together make a totally different result.",
      "Brian: The city of Townsville. A great city with many of the same things as any other city. Shops and malls and movie houses too. Great parks, corporate art, a fantastic museum.",
      "Brian: The newly renovated and revitalized Old Townsville district. It even boasts an animal shelter. But Townsville has something extra. Townsville has the Powerpuff Girls.",
      "Brian: Although this bus looks better than that corporate art, it's actually a reminder of another battle that took place here in Townsville.",
      "Brian: There are other reminders and countless monuments where three little girls saved this wonderful city.",
      "Brian: Their photos have graced newspapers and tabloids numerous times.",
      "Brian: They have merchandising... and even their own TV show. They live here, in this quiet suburb of Townsville. And what better place to begin my journey into their inner workings than at the home of the Powerpuff Girls?",
      "Brian: My first visit was unannounced... and just as I arrived...",
      "Brian: the girls flew away. Three bright streaks cut through the daytime sky. I hoped they were off to fight crime and not avoiding me.",
      "Brian: Okay... I'm driving up through the city, and there's loads of traffic. I- I- I can't really see anything yet, I-",
      "Brian: I keep trying to get closer, but the battle keeps moving. Oh, no!",
      "Brian: I'm- I'm okay, now I'm gonna get out of my car to get a better an-",
      "Brian: And just when I thought I was going to capture something really great... it was over. All that I caught was three streaks of light flying away.",
      "Brian: And although I played this cat- and- mouse game with them all day with no success, I wasn't gonna let that stop me from making my film. If I couldn't get to the girls personally, I was gonna have to settle on the next best thing... talking to the people who do.",
      "Brian: I started at their school, the Pokey Oaks. Ms. Keane is their teacher, and I sat with her to find out what I could about the Powerpuff Girls.",
      "Ms. Keane: Well, let me tell you, the girls are fantastic. All of their grades are good. Buttercup is really coming out of her shell and learning how to play with others. Ooh, and just look at the drawing Bubbles did. Absolutely adorable!  Ooh, and Blossom told this joke the other day that had the entire cafeteria squirting milk out of their noses!",
      "Brian: Could you tell me more about the Powerpuff side of the girls? About their commitment to fighting crime and the pre- adolescent behavior of dealing with violence at such a young age?",
      "Ms. Keane: Well, um... I'm their teacher. I really don't know about that part of their lives.",
      "Brian: As I left the school, I happened upon the trash man. His name is Carl.",
      "Carl: About the Powerpuff Girls, huh? Well, they keep me busy... cleanin' up all the trash and debris they leave behind after all their fights. Helps the economy, you know... always buildin' and rebuildin' and workin' and whatnot. Tell you what, though, it's a problem for traffic.",
      "Brian: I didn't get much from Carl. But he gave me an idea.",
      "Brian: This is Dave, the local cop who hauled me in for sifting through the Powerpuff Girls' trash cans.",
      "Dave: Oh, yeah. I been in a few sticky situations with them. I mean, really sticky. One time, there was this taffy factory, and... but you really had to be there. You know, they really don't have law enforcement training in the classical sense. I've certainly had to back 'em up more than once. Ah, copy that, ten- four.",
      "Dave: Naah, I don't have monster enforcement training or special powers or save the city on a daily basis, but, uh... hey, uh, what's your point? Hey, you want to work the sirens?",
      "Brian: With little luck on the grassroots level, I decided to go to the one person who calls upon their services all the time: the Mayor.",
      "Mayor: Okay, everyone. That about does it for the pay raises and extended vacation time.",
      "Brian: Ah, Mayor!  Uh, hi. I'm shooting a documentary, and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?",
      "Mayor: Look, I don't know nothin' about nothin'!  You can't prove it, I wasn't there, I was young and I needed the money!",
      "Ms. Bellum: I'm sorry, but you're going to have to leave.",
      "Brian: Uh, just let me ask a few questions.",
      "Ms. Bellum: Uh, this is an unannounced visit. Security!",
      "Brian: Don't touch the camera!",
      "Brian: That really didn't get me anywhere. With my interview lacking any real information or substance, I decided to hit the streets again.",
      "Talking Dog: I'm a talking dog. That is so much better than three boring girls. No report or documentary's ever been done on me. Not one question! Not one survey! I mean... come on. I'm a talking dog!",
      "Brian: Having dealt with the positive side of the spectrum, I decided to find the people who knew them on a working level: their evil counterparts.",
      "Brian: But this proved even more fleeting.",
      "Princess: Sorry. No interviews!",
      "Fuzzy: GET OFFA MY PROPERTY, DAGNABIT!",
      "Brian: Yeah, but wait, I just want to...",
      "Fuzzy: NO TRESPASSIN'! OFF!",
      "Brian: Mr. Mojo? Uh, hi. My name is Brian, and I'm making a documentary, and I'd like to talk with you...",
      "Mojo: Can't talk, planning evil scheme.",
      "Brian: With all the opinions and facts I gathered about the Powerpuff Girls, I decided to go back to the source and see if I could capture the girls in action around town.",
      "Brian: I found Officer Dave again, in hopes that he could alert me to the Powerpuff Girls' battles.",
      "Brian: After Officer Dave showed me a few police tricks, we hit the road.",
      "Brian: And it wasn't long before we got the call.",
      "Dispatcher: Monster attack on the west side. All available units, please respond.",
      "Brian: But by the time we got there, the battle was over and the girls were gone. Battle after battle... the Powerpuff Girls eluded my every effort.",
      "Punk: Yo, yo, you totally missed it! It was tight!  I mean, it was totally wizzack!  I even got the thing on camera, dog.",
      "Old woman: I see the Powerpuff Girls all the time. They help me cross the street.",
      "Man: Yes, they offer me help all the time. Can't get them to stop bugging me.",
      "Shank: Yeah. I worked with them. They're about this big.",
      "Brian: It was as if they were avoiding me.",
      "Brian: Okay. This is a re- enactment of the Powerpuff Girls in action, saving Townsville from Mojo Jojo.",
      "Toddler: Mojo doggie!",
      "Girl: That is it, Brian! I am through with you and your obsession with the Powerpuff Girls! I am leaving!",
      "Brian: But, Beth, honey, I... come on, wait!",
      "Toddler: Yaaay! Attack doggie!",
      "Brian: Beth was right. Who was I kidding?! I'm just some film school hack trying to obtain the unattainable. My documentary on the Powerpuff Girls was turning into a documentary on how to fail at making a documentary on the Powerpuff Girls.",
      "Brian: That was, until I was packing up my gear, and suddenly...",
      "Brian: Oh, my gosh, it's Mojo Jojo!",
      "Brian: Oh, my gosh, I can't believe this! Okay. Okay, stay calm... breathe... breathe, breathe, keep the camera steady. Remember what they taught you in film school... okay... okay.",
      "Blossom: Give it up, Mojo!",
      "Mojo: Never!",
      "Brian: I'm standing right in front of Mojo Jojo, and he seems to be looking right at me.",
      "Mojo: Not only do I have a hostage, I have a camera too! Hello!",
      "Blossom: What are you gonna do with him?",
      "Mojo: Mmm... I might drop him.",
      "Bubbles: You wouldn't dare!",
      "Bubbles: Gotcha!",
      "Bubbles: Stay here, Mr. Man.",
      "Brian: Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow... oh, wow!",
      "Buttercup: Hey, look! We're on camera!",
      "Bubbles: Hi, Professor!",
      "Brian: Whoa! Can you believe that?! I mean, that was so awesome! I- I can't believe it, I mean, this is great! Never in all my days did I think I could get something like that! I- I realize now that it's not about what makes the girls tick; it's about the fact that once again the day is saved, thanks to the Powerpuff Girls! Whooooo!"

      "Bernie: Right. So, like I said, you three'll come through the breakaway wall. You'll zip over here, do the little fight thing with the stuntmen here, yadda, yadda, yadda, and then... oh. Donnie! Bring in the Mayor!",

      "Blossom: It's so apparent!  It's obvious that the liar would say that the real Ms. Keane would say that the fake Ms. Keane is the real Ms. Keane. And conversely, the real Ms. Keane would say that the fake Ms. Keane would say she is the real Ms. Keane. So, therefore, the real Ms. Keane is none other than... number two!",
      "'Him': She's right.",
      "Blossom: Right on time!  High five! Bring on the next riddle, evil dude, I'm smokin'!",
      "'Him': You think you're so smart?!",
      "'Him': Then let's see how you score on the SATs!",
      "Blossom: What?",

      "'Him': You have one minute. Begin!",
      "'Him': Time's up!",
      "Buttercup: Huh?!",
      "'Him': Put your number- two pencils down and pass your papers forward.",

      "Blossom: One riddle left, 'Him,' and the Professor is as good as ours!",
      "'Him': We'll see, won't we? You will find your Professor when you solve this last rhyme. Where is boiling and freezing at the same time?",
      "'Him': The Professor will pay! Thirty seconds!",
      "Blossom: Boiling and freezing... boiling and freezing...",
      "Buttercup: What could that mean?",
      "Mayor: It's coordinates.",
      "Girls: Huh?",
      "Mayor: Sure, it's code. The freezing point of water is thirty- two degrees Fahrenheit, while the boiling point is two hundred twelve degrees. Two hundred twelve degrees west of the Greenwich Mean Time on the longitudinal axis, by thirty- two degrees north of the equator on the latitudinal axis, maps a specific point on the globe, that point being right here in the city of Townsville, the intersection of Lincoln and Main, to be exact. Or it could be there's an ice cream truck on fire somewhere. Have a nice day, girls!",

      "Professor: Here's your money, 'Him'! Your flapjacks are good, but not that good! I'm never eating here again!",

      "Madame Argentina: Why, me, of course.",

      "MA: And now, if you'll excuse me, I am expecting a client  for a 4: 00 appointment.",
      "Narrator: Oh, no! It's the Mayor of Townsville, the one person who should've read the newspaper today, but didn't.",

Which, of course, left the real Powerpuff Girls dangling precariously over the edge of a cliff.",

I don't mind; I think they're crazy. But you used to be running everywhere at such a speed. Now you think there's no need.",

      "Blossom: But what can we do?",
      "Professor: Well, first you have to realize the Beat Alls are just a rock band.",
      "Girls: Huh?",
      "Professor: Fuzzy. He does that... rock thing, you- you know. But that's not important. But what is important is this. Mojo Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner, but he knew it couldn't last. He's just getting by with a little help from his friends.",
      "Buttercup: Are you saying we should try and break up the Beat Alls?",

      "Princess: So tell us again why we're only stealing toilet paper, light bulbs, milk, flour, and eggs.",

      "Cop: You realize that you were walking in the crosswalk after the green walking man had stopped being displayed, and when the flashing red hand had become the prominent visual.",
      "Old lady: And while I appreciate the change in the crosswalk signage, the fact of the matter is, I am of elderly persuasion, and due to the deterioration of calcium level in my bones, my pedestrian abilities, which is to say my walking, is of a much slower pace than the average citizen of Townsville.",
      "Buttercup: Is this a crime?",
      "Blossom: No, just annoying.",

      "Blossom: To the bank!",
      "Robber: The amount which I want to withdraw is not that from any bank account which I hold within a bank; in other words, I wish to take money that does not belong to me but is instead in the ownership of others who have worked hard to gather funds for their future rainy days.",
      "Banklady: But what I am asking you is, do you have an account which I can access, and, if so, what are the numerical digits for me to properly type upon the keyboard to tap into the computer system which allows me permission into all the fund- related requests.",
      "Robber: And what you are failing to understand is that I do not have said accounts since I am not a patron of this fine establishment except to take from it that which is not mine.",

With the skill of Mo' Linguish, the world, which was previously not yours to be taken, will be at your fingertips!",
      "Blossom: That's it!",
      "Buttercup: He's done it!",
      "Bubbles: Mojo has managed to bring Townsville to a complete standstill, by having all of the people speak in the most lengthy of questions, and redundant of answers? Thus, nothing can be asked or answered without the verbosity of words, causing the city to come to a permanent and most painful halt, furthermore-",
      "Buttercup and Blossom: Bubbles!",
      "Bubbles: Sorry!",

      "Cop: But if I were to speak briefly, it would mean that I did not speak all that I wish to have spoken, meaning that I would not fully express myself to the fullest and thus spoken in too small of a sentence to properly satisfy.",
      "Old lady: And if I simply said: 'yes' or 'no', the reasoning behind that 'yes' or 'no' would be unheard and unvoiced, and un- pontificated, thus leaving me with a feeling of stifled combustion that would be ready to explode.",
      "Buttercup: Aw, this isn't going to work!",

      "Buttercup and Blossom: Bubbles!",

Simply roll over the city’s tax-sheltered annuities to small-growth mutual funds; adjust the GPG status accordingly; conduct a sweeping inquiry that will root out and dispose of corrupt city officials, resulting in a substantial tax reduction for the people. Then, with the leftover funds— —make a fully tax-deductible donation to the Home for the Elderly, Minorities, and War Veterans…Capital, sure, anytime. Think nothing of it.",

      "Blossom: Tell her to stay with us!",
      "Blossom: Tell her we'll give her all the nuts she wants!",
