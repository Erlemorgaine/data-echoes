      "Yes, it is Christmas, just two days before,",
      "And all through the town, none can wait anymore...",
      "For the timely arrival of one certain fat guy...",
      "Who brings us all goodies from out of the sky.",
      "Full of anticipation are these urban folks,",

      "Buttercup: Writing my wish list for Santa.",

      "Princess Morebucks: Hah!",
      "Princess: Who would want a stupid old BB gun?",
      "Girls: Princess!",
      "Princess: Besides, you'll shoot your eye out. Since my daddy buys me anything I want, I only have one thing on my list for Santa: to be a Powerpuff Girl!",
      "Blossom: Don't hold your breath, Princess.",
      "Princess: What?! Why?!",
      "Bubbles: Because Santa has his own list, and he checks it twice. It says who's naughty and who's nice.",
      "Princess: So?",

      "Blossom: You're a spoiled brat who's greedy and jealous, and you don't care who you step on to get what you want!",
      "Princess: And your point is...?",
      "Blossom: The point, Princess, is that you better change your ways, or all you're ever gonna get from Santa is a big fat lump of coal in your stocking.",
      "Ms. Keane: Okay, kids... ooh! Hold your horses.",
      "Ms. Keane: Bye- bye now. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Be nice for Santa.",

      "Princess: Naughty, huh? I'll show you who's naughty!",
      "Princess: And all these years I thought that coal in my stocking came from Daddy's coal mine!",
      "Princess: Who does that blimp think he is, denying me presents?",
      "Princess: Well, this time I am gonna be a Powerpuff Girl!  And I'm sure not gonna let some elf with a weight problem stop me!",

      "Bubbles: I know I heard him.",
      "Bubbles: What?  The stockings!",
      "Bubbles: No!",
      "Bubbles: No, no, no, no! Noooo!",

      "Bubbles: No!",
      "Blossom: Whoo- hoo!",
      "Bubbles: But wait!",
      "Buttercup: What the heck?",
      "Blossom: Santa hasn't even been here yet!",
      "Bubbles: Yeah- huh. I heard reindeer on the roof.",
      "Buttercup: Oh, yeah? Then where are all the presents?",
      "Bubbles: That's what I've been trying to tell you! THERE ARE NO PRESENTS!",
      "Blossom, Buttercup: What?!?",
      "Bubbles: Listen, okay, okay. Me and Octi were dancing with pirates in a pond, when a man in a gorilla suit started yelling. So I woke up, and then I heard Santa on the roof. And I tried to wake you up, but I couldn't, 'cause you wouldn't wake up. So I went down the hallway, and the Professor was snoring... so I came downstairs to see what Santa left... even though I know I'm not supposed to. But there weren't any presents under the tree, just ornaments hanging!  Like that cute little shoveling- snowman one, which is really my favorite because it's funny that a snowman would be shoveling snow, when he's made of snow!  So then I looked in my stocking, but there wasn't candy. Instead, there was coal! Can you believe it? Coal! In my stocking! Which is just ridiculous, 'cause why would Santa give me coal? So I looked in your stockings, and there was coal there too! So I looked next door, and they didn't have any gifts either! Only coal in their stockings, and all the other kids on the block!",
      "Blossom: You went through other kids' stockings?!",
      "Bubbles: No! I saw through the houses. Duh! X- ray vision!",
      "Blossom: Bubbles, you should know better.",
      "Buttercup: No wonder you got coal in your stocking.",
      "Bubbles: I already had coal in my stocking before I looked at the other kids' stockings!",
      "Buttercup: Oh, really? Then why don't me and Blossom have coal in our stockings?",
      "Bubbles: You do!",
      "Blossom: Me?",
      "Buttercup: You gotta be kidding.",
      "Blossom: Really?",
      "Buttercup: Nuh- uh.",
      "Blossom: Buttercup I can understand, but... me?",
      "Buttercup: Hey!",
      "Bubbles: See?",
      "Blossom: This can't be right.",
      "Buttercup: Um... yeah!",
      "Bubbles: It- it was a mistake. He must not have checked his list twice like he's supposed to.",
      "Blossom: We better find Santa and set this straight. Ho...",
      "Bubbles: ho...",
      "Buttercup: ho!",
      "Girls: Let's go!",
      "Princess: Hello, Powerpuffs!  I've come to deliver you your Christmas present: A fourth and more powerful member of your team!",
      "Princess: Me! Princess!",
      "Girls: What?!",
      "Princess: That's right! You can't deny me any longer!  Santa realized that I was the only truly nice kid in the whole world and that you were naughty for not giving me what I want!",
      "Princess: So now every kid in the world gets coal! And I get what I've always deserved: To be a Powerpuff Girl!",
      "Buttercup: This is so wrong!",
      "Blossom: How could Santa believe that Princess is nice?!",
      "Bubbles: Excuse me?! How could Santa believe that I am naughty?!",
      "Buttercup: 'Cause you snooped on other people's presents!",
      "Bubbles: Look. I already told you, I only looked 'cause we didn't have any presents, so I wanted to see if any other kids had any presents.",
      "Blossom: Enough chatter, girls. We better find Santa and fast.",
      "Princess: Oh, no, you don't. I knew you conceited little ingrates wouldn't be able to accept the fact that Santa thinks you're naughty.",
      "Princess: But I'm not gonna let you brats ruin my Christmas.",
      "Buttercup: Forget it, Princess. We're so gonna tell Santa on you!",
      "Princess: Not if I tell on you first.",
      "Bubbles: We didn't do anything?",
      "Princess: Oh, yeah?  'Oh, Santa Claus, as the only nice child in the whole world, I felt it was my duty to warn you about the three naughty girls who were so angry you gave them coal...'  '... that they're coming to destroy your workshop and ruin Christmas forever.'  Oh, Santa...",
      "Buttercup: Bubbles!",
      "Blossom: She'll catch up. We can't let Princess get ahead of us.",
      "Buttercup: Ow! Quit it!  Ow! Quit it!  Ow! Quit it!",
      "Buttercup: QUIT IT!!!",
      "Princess: Thanks, Einstein!",
      "Blossom: Good job, Buttercup.",
      "Bubbles: Yeah, nice one.",
      "Buttercup: Oh, shut up!",
      "Princess: Out of the park!  Two down...",
      "Blossom: Ha! Payback!",
      "Princess: Thanks, Einstein!",
      "Princess: No fair!",
      "Princess: No fair!",
      "Princess: NO FAIR!",
      "Princess: Cool it, girls!",
      "Princess: Hey! How'd you like my stocking stuffer?",
      "Buttercup: Stuff that!  I can't believe that worked.",
      "Narrator: More rapid than eagles, the coursers they came,",
      "And they screamed and they shouted and called each other names.",
      "But in a toymaker's shop way up ahead,",
      "A jolly old elf was filled up with dread.",
      "Narrator: This one Christmas Eve weighed great on his soul,",
      "Back from his night of delivering coal.",
      "Santa: Ho ho ho!  What's with all the crashing and the smashing, and the smashing and the crashing?! Huh?! I'm out delivering coal all night long, and I come home to the Smashing- and- Crashing Gang?!",
      "Bubbles: But-",
      "Santa: Uh- uh! No buts! I ain't listenin' to no buts from some no- good naughty kids! And no no- good little naughty kids are gonna tell me what's what!",
      "Santa: 'Cause guess what?",
      "Santa: ANSWER ME!!!",
      "Blossom: Uh...",
      "Santa: That's right! First time, first time it's ever happened. Every last little no- good, good- for- nothin' kid in the stinkin' world was naughty!",
      "Santa: Naughty! Naughty! Naughty little kids the world over!  Except for one. One nice sweet little girl.",
      "Buttercup: You're wrong!",
      "Santa: Oh, I am, huh?!  Well, I's gots the list, baby.",
      "Santa: Check it!",
      "Princess: Yeah! Check it!",
      "Santa: Yeah! A million bazillion good- for- nothin's on this list!  And one little itty bitty, perfect little angel over here.",
      "Princess: Nyah!",
      "Bubbles: That's not right!  Maybe you didn't check the list twice!",
      "Buttercup: Yeah! Princess is the naughtiest kid ever!",
      "Blossom: She must've snuck up here and switched the lists!",
      "Princess: Nuh- uh!  Santa, don't listen to them! They're just jealous 'cause they got coal.",
      "Princess: They're jealous 'cause I'm nicer, I'm smarter, and I'm prettier, and I'm better than them so they wouldn't let me be a Powerpuff Girl. That makes them naughty!",
      "Santa: You mean, the Powerpuff Girls?  Not the same Powerpuff Girls who are always helping people and saving the day and being really good?  I mean, really good?",
      "Santa: Yeah, yeah. See, that explains all the flying and floating and stuff.",
      "Princess: But I should be a Powerpuff Girl! Me! Not them! Me! My daddy says I'm better! My daddy says I'm the best! And if you're too much of a fatheaded fathead to see that, I'll tell my daddy!",
      "Princess: And he'll come and build a parking lot over this cheap little arts- and- crafts popsicle stand of yours!",
      "Princess: Got it?!",
      "Princess: So, you better give me whatever I want for Christmas.....'cause my daddy says I get whatever I want, whenever I want it! And if that means all of those lousy, worthless, second- rate, bargain- basement brats in the world don't get anything for Christmas, then that's just the way it's gonna have to be!",
      "Princess: 'Cause I am better than them!  And it says so right here!",
      "Princess: So put that in your pipe and smoke it, Santa Clod!",
      "Santa: LIST, SCHMIST!  I don't need no stinkin' list tellin' me who's naughty and who's nice!",
      "Santa: You know why? 'Cause I'm Santa Claus!  Check it! Princess...",
      "Santa: You have gone and worked my last nerve!",
      "Santa: I have no other choice. You are so rotten, so despicable, so naughty... I'm putting you on the...",
      "Santa: Permanent Naughty Plaque!",
      "Santa: Bum- bum- bummm!",
      "Princess: You can't do that!  I'm telling my daddy!",
      "Princess: NO FAIR!",
      "Buttercup: Wow, Santa! We didn't know you could give kids superpowers for Christmas.",
      "Santa: Eh. No one's ever asked.",
      "Blossom: Santa, it's almost morning! What about all the nice children who got coal?",
      "Santa: It's all right, girls. I've pulled rush jobs before. All it takes is...",
      "Bubbles: All those poor boys and girls.",
      "Santa: Hundreds of years of perfect attendance.",
      "Santa: A couple of close calls... but we've always made it. But now... I'm ruined.",
      "Santa: Powerpuff Girls, with your streaks so bright, won't you deliver the Christmas gifts tonight?",
      "Blossom: We'd be honored, Santa, and we'll do our best.",
      "Santa: Good, 'cause my head's killing me.",
      "Narrator: So all 'round the world the Powerpuffs flew,",
      "With a sack full of toys and a giggle or two.",
      "They knew that their job was to fly through the skies...",
      "And deliver the gifts before the sun should arise.",
      "They spoke not a word, but took care of their deed,",
      "Delivering gifts at a breakneck speed.",
      "Narrator: Their streaks ribboned the sky, their swiftness severe.",
      "They'd have sure been the envy of eight certain reindeer.",
      "In and out of all chimneys, each and every abode,",
      "Gift by gift, they completed the task they were bestowed.",
      "Dollies and race cars, horseys, choo- choos, and blocks,",
      "Teddy bears! Puppy dogs!  Underwear and socks.",
      "All these items slipped under every child's tree,",
      "Arranged rather nicely by these super girls three.",
      "Narrator: They were making good time, even though they were rookies,",
      "So they stopped once or twice to have milk and some cookies.",
      "Narrator: Then at last they were done whew! just before dawn.",
      "So they sped back to Townsville, to home with a yawn.",
      "Narrator: They entered their room, for the wear no less worn,",
      "And snuggled into bed to await Christmas morn.",
      "Professor: Girls! Wake up! Wake up!  It's Christmas! It's Christmas!  He came! Santa came!",
      "Professor: Come on, come on! Let's go open the presents, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!  I think somebody might have gotten that new atom splitter they've been eyeing!",
      "Professor: Come on, come on, come on, come on!",
      "Bubbles: Professor, it's too early!",
      "Blossom: We'll open presents later.",
      "Buttercup: Go back to bed!",
      "Bubbles: Wait a minute.",
      "Blossom: What are we saying?",
      "Buttercup: Who cares if we're tired?",
      "Girls: It's Christmas!",
      "Girls: Presents!",
      "Narrator: Now all the nice kids of the world won't get stiffed.",
      "They'll look on with pure joy at every wrapped gift.",
      "So paper's torn open and ribbon unfurls,",
      "'Cause Christmas was saved...",
      "... thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!"

Where are they going? I want to know everything about them. Yes, the Powerpuff Girls!  What are their hopes and dreams, their desires and aspirations? Do they fight crime all day? Do they set aside a certain portion of it for leisure? How tall are they, and what are their shoe sizes? Where do they sleep, and what do they eat for breakfast? Do they put jam on their toast, or don't they put jam on their toast? And if not, why not? And since when?",

      "Brian: Sugar... spice... and everything nice.",
      "Brian: Yep, those are pretty normal ingredients, all right. Mix 'em all together, and they pretty much make... mush. But to the city of Townsville, those three special ingredients together make a totally different result.",

      "Brian: And although I played this cat- and- mouse game with them all day with no success, I wasn't gonna let that stop me from making my film. If I couldn't get to the girls personally, I was gonna have to settle on the next best thing... talking to the people who do.",
      "Brian: I started at their school, the Pokey Oaks. Ms. Keane is their teacher, and I sat with her to find out what I could about the Powerpuff Girls.",
      "Ms. Keane: Well, let me tell you, the girls are fantastic. All of their grades are good. Buttercup is really coming out of her shell and learning how to play with others. Ooh, and just look at the drawing Bubbles did. Absolutely adorable!  Ooh, and Blossom told this joke the other day that had the entire cafeteria squirting milk out of their noses!",
      "Brian: Could you tell me more about the Powerpuff side of the girls? About their commitment to fighting crime and the pre- adolescent behavior of dealing with violence at such a young age?",
      "Ms. Keane: Well, um... I'm their teacher. I really don't know about that part of their lives.",
      "Brian: As I left the school, I happened upon the trash man. His name is Carl.",
      "Carl: About the Powerpuff Girls, huh? Well, they keep me busy... cleanin' up all the trash and debris they leave behind after all their fights. Helps the economy, you know... always buildin' and rebuildin' and workin' and whatnot. Tell you what, though, it's a problem for traffic.",
      "Brian: I didn't get much from Carl. But he gave me an idea.",
      "Brian: This is Dave, the local cop who hauled me in for sifting through the Powerpuff Girls' trash cans.",
      "Dave: Oh, yeah. I been in a few sticky situations with them. I mean, really sticky. One time, there was this taffy factory, and... but you really had to be there. You know, they really don't have law enforcement training in the classical sense. I've certainly had to back 'em up more than once. Ah, copy that, ten- four.",
      "Dave: Naah, I don't have monster enforcement training or special powers or save the city on a daily basis, but, uh... hey, uh, what's your point? Hey, you want to work the sirens?",
      "Brian: With little luck on the grassroots level, I decided to go to the one person who calls upon their services all the time: the Mayor.",
      "Mayor: Okay, everyone. That about does it for the pay raises and extended vacation time.",
      "Brian: Ah, Mayor!  Uh, hi. I'm shooting a documentary, and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?",
      "Mayor: Look, I don't know nothin' about nothin'!  You can't prove it, I wasn't there, I was young and I needed the money!",
      "Ms. Bellum: I'm sorry, but you're going to have to leave.",
      "Brian: Uh, just let me ask a few questions.",
      "Ms. Bellum: Uh, this is an unannounced visit. Security!",
      "Brian: Don't touch the camera!",
      "Brian: That really didn't get me anywhere. With my interview lacking any real information or substance, I decided to hit the streets again.",
      "Talking Dog: I'm a talking dog. That is so much better than three boring girls. No report or documentary's ever been done on me. Not one question! Not one survey! I mean... come on. I'm a talking dog!",
      "Brian: Having dealt with the positive side of the spectrum, I decided to find the people who knew them on a working level: their evil counterparts.",
      "Brian: But this proved even more fleeting.",
      "Princess: Sorry. No interviews!",
      "Fuzzy: GET OFFA MY PROPERTY, DAGNABIT!",
      "Brian: Yeah, but wait, I just want to...",
      "Fuzzy: NO TRESPASSIN'! OFF!",
      "Brian: Mr. Mojo? Uh, hi. My name is Brian, and I'm making a documentary, and I'd like to talk with you...",
      "Mojo: Can't talk, planning evil scheme.",
      "Brian: With all the opinions and facts I gathered about the Powerpuff Girls, I decided to go back to the source and see if I could capture the girls in action around town.",
      "Brian: I found Officer Dave again, in hopes that he could alert me to the Powerpuff Girls' battles.",
      "Brian: After Officer Dave showed me a few police tricks, we hit the road.",
      "Brian: And it wasn't long before we got the call.",
      "Dispatcher: Monster attack on the west side. All available units, please respond.",
      "Brian: But by the time we got there, the battle was over and the girls were gone. Battle after battle... the Powerpuff Girls eluded my every effort.",
      "Punk: Yo, yo, you totally missed it! It was tight!  I mean, it was totally wizzack!  I even got the thing on camera, dog.",
      "Old woman: I see the Powerpuff Girls all the time. They help me cross the street.",
      "Man: Yes, they offer me help all the time. Can't get them to stop bugging me.",
      "Shank: Yeah. I worked with them. They're about this big.",
      "Brian: It was as if they were avoiding me.",
      "Brian: Okay. This is a re- enactment of the Powerpuff Girls in action, saving Townsville from Mojo Jojo.",
      "Toddler: Mojo doggie!",
      "Girl: That is it, Brian! I am through with you and your obsession with the Powerpuff Girls! I am leaving!",
      "Brian: But, Beth, honey, I... come on, wait!",
      "Toddler: Yaaay! Attack doggie!",
      "Brian: Beth was right. Who was I kidding?! I'm just some film school hack trying to obtain the unattainable. My documentary on the Powerpuff Girls was turning into a documentary on how to fail at making a documentary on the Powerpuff Girls.",
      "Brian: That was, until I was packing up my gear, and suddenly...",
      "Brian: Oh, my gosh, it's Mojo Jojo!",
      "Brian: Oh, my gosh, I can't believe this! Okay. Okay, stay calm... breathe... breathe, breathe, keep the camera steady. Remember what they taught you in film school... okay... okay.",
      "Blossom: Give it up, Mojo!",
      "Mojo: Never!",
      "Brian: I'm standing right in front of Mojo Jojo, and he seems to be looking right at me.",
      "Mojo: Not only do I have a hostage, I have a camera too! Hello!",
      "Blossom: What are you gonna do with him?",
      "Mojo: Mmm... I might drop him.",
      "Bubbles: You wouldn't dare!",
      "Bubbles: Gotcha!",
      "Bubbles: Stay here, Mr. Man.",
      "Brian: Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow... oh, wow!",
      "Buttercup: Hey, look! We're on camera!",
      "Bubbles: Hi, Professor!",
      "Brian: Whoa! Can you believe that?! I mean, that was so awesome! I- I can't believe it, I mean, this is great! Never in all my days did I think I could get something like that! I- I realize now that it's not about what makes the girls tick; it's about the fact that once again the day is saved, thanks to the Powerpuff Girls! Whooooo!"

He could fly and stuff. So I set out to to create the Perfect Little Girl who could fly further and stuff, but I accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concoction- Chemical W. Thus the Perfect Little Girl was born.",

      "Bubbles: Maybe he can help us prove the existence of the Ghost horse! Buttercup: You mean the one that haunts this very school? They say at night, you can hear him clip- clopping down the hallways.Buttercup: then Bubbles: It's both scary And adorable! Blossom: Please! That's ridiculous.Blossom: Oh! Here he comes! Good day, everyone! As some of you may already be aware, my name is miste Err doctor Blossom: Dr.Rupert Kensington, ph.D! Jainitaur: Why, yes! That's me! Uh, and as you may also know, I'm very famous for science- ing! Why why, I single- handedly created the Uh, the, uh Blossom: Oh! The transmutation ray! I've read all of your books on it! Buttercup: Boring.Blossom: No! Don't you see? Using his transmutation ray, he infused carrot DNA into a grapefruit to create a carrotfruit! Buttercup: Still boring. A- as you know, I'll be teaching your class this week, and Blossom: 'And'?! There's an 'and'!? Jainitaur: I will be judging your science fair next week and And?! And awarding this, uh, prestigious, er, blue ribbon to the student with the most impressive science fair project.Jainitaur: Er, anyway, I hope to be impressed.I hear some minds here are rather sharp! Buttercup: He's talking about me! Bubbles: I know what project will blow everyone's minds! 'The ghost horse.' Fact or Very true fact?! Blossom: Uh, bubbles? Buttercup: I agree, blossom.This is literally the best idea I've ever heard! Bubbles and Buuttercup: Ghost horse! Ghost horse! Ghost horse! Ghost horse! Jainitaur Blossom, may I have a word? Blossom: As many as you like, sir!  Jainitaur: Ah, have you given any thought yet as to what you might do for your science fair project? Blossom: Oh, yes! I've been compiling a list of multiple projects for months, such as A baking soda volcano! A bit simple, don't you think? You're right.Blossom: Tornado tube? Jainitaur: No.Blossom: Ant farm derby? Jainitaur: No.Blossom: Papier- maché brain? Jainitaur: No.Blossom: Cold fusion?! Jainitaur: No, thanks, I already ate.Jainitaur: I was thinking of something more along the lines of This! A blueprint for a genuine transmutation ray! Yes! But perhaps it's time for an upgrade Something that will mutate not just plants, but animals Or even humans! You could make, for example, people- sheep, or sheep people, or uh, what do you call 'em? Blossom: Sheeple? That's the one! Blossom: While that does sound like an amazing idea, sir, wouldn't it be dangerous? Jainitaur: Ah! True, true.But, sometimes, you have to do dangerous things for the good of society! That's how hang gliding was invented! Not to mention, a project like that would certainly be worthy of the blue ribbon award.Yes! And the person who made it would even be worthy of being My assistant.Or, dare I say, my lab partner.But maybe you're not up to the challenge.Blossom: Yes, I am! Excuse me, Dr.Kensington, I have some groundbreaking work to break ground on! Ms Keane: I'd like to welcome everyone to this year's science fair!  Let's get on with the judging! Jainitaur: Hmm No.No.Mm, unh- unh.Hmm.Jainitaur: Ghost horse? Yeah! That's right! Hit the lights! Buttercup: The ghost horse is real, people! Haven't you all noticed how messy it is? The janitor's not been doing his job because he's been Ghost- napped! Bubbles: And we've tracked his ghost prints from the boiler room where the janitor hangs out right to the office of Dr.Rupert Kensington, ph.D! Buttercup: Where are you hiding the ghost horse, huh?  Blossom I, uh Well, I Okay I think that's enough with the crazy talk.Let me show you some real science.Bubbles: This thing didn't end with roswell, it started with roswell! Blossom: I'm so sorry about my sisters, sir! Jainitaur: That's quite all right.Now, let's see your project.I'm very excited about it.Me, too! I give you The transmutator 2.5! Hmm Allow me to demonstrate.Blossom: As you'll see in this simulation, I can use the transmutator to combine the DNA of a human with any animal.Jainitaur: Like so Well, that's nice, but that's just a doll.Would this machine work on real animals and real people? Blossom: Yes, of course! Good! Wha- what? Dr.Kensington?! Jainitaur: I am not Dr.Kensington.It's the janitor! I'd prefer if you called me by my real name Janitaur! Whew! That takes some serious core strength.Ms. Keane: Oh, and he's a centaur, apparently.Blossom: W- what? How is this possible? Buttercup: Allow us to explain.According to our research, the ghost horse started appearing after the science fair explosion of 1992.During which, the student who caused the explosion, Wendell feinstein the most careless student in school Disappeared! Bubbles: Sometime later, a new janitor was hired A janitor with a posterior most superior.What? He had a giant butt! That dude's the real ghost horse! Jainitaur: Thanks for the introduction, girls.Now to unleash my plan, and make all of you half- animal freaks like me! Blossom: Why didn't you just have me build a machine to make you human again? Jainitaur: Oh! Why didn't I think of that! Buttercup: Most careless student.Bubbles: Eep! Oh, my gosh! They're so cute! Ahh! Huh? I'm a bee? Yay! I'm a bee! Buttercup: Bubbs, no! Aah! Wow.Awesome A flamingo.Blossom: Hey! Whoa! Watch out! Oh, boy! Excuse me.Okay, janitaur, time to bring down the hammer! Hyah! Dr Kensignton: Help me! I'm Dr.Kensington The real Dr.Kensington! Wait!You're the real Dr.Kensington? Oh, my gosh! I can't believe it's really you! Sir, I just want to say Aah! Dr.Kensington! I will avenge thee in the name of science! Oof! And now to turn all of townsville into freaks like me! Blossom: Ort, ort! Bubbles, buttercup, stop him! Oh, yeah Hello.Bubbles: I'm here to bug you! Ugh, gross! Stop it! Go away! Quit it! Knock it off! Grrrrr! Stop it! Huh? We did it! It doesn't matter! There's no way to reverse the effects now! Or is there?! You forgot, I'm an ort- ver achiever! Whoa, sweet! You!You! That's right! I knew the ray was too dangerous, so I built a second device to reverse the effects.Ms. Keane: No! When you get a chance, could you sweep this mess up? Thanks.Dr Kensignton: And so the winner of the science fair and blue ribbon award goes toBlossom: Aw.I don't deserve to win.Dr Kensignton: Bubbles and buttercup! Aw.Blossom: I kind of thought I was still gonna win.Dr Kensignton: Bubbles and buttercup's project was not only proven through ahem A form of scientific method, it also didn't compromise their scientific integrity.I couldn't agree more, doctor Kensington, ph.D! But Is this really the end of the mystery? Or is this not the real Dr.Kensington,either? Dr.Kensington: Er, what?! Guys, stop! Buttercyp: Remove your mask, imposter! Dr.Kensington: I'm not an imposter! Jainitaur: Stupid science!",

      "Buttercup: Hah! Oh, yeah?! Wanna fight about it?!",
      "Mayor: Well, golly gee, Mr. Bernstein! You want permits to film in the Townsville Bank... and the use of all its money, and full police jurisdiction in a four- mile radius?",
      "Bernie: So what's the problem?",
      "Mayor: Well, it's... kind of a lot, isn't it?",
      "Bernie: Look, Mr. Mayor. I understand how you feel. I mean, when Mr. S came to me with that big war picture and nobody would touch it, I had fears. I had doubts. But did I let that stop me from doing what I believed?  HECK NO!  And we knocked the pants off 'em with that one! And now...",

      "Bernie: now, when I ask you... you, a truly beautiful man, with the class and charm of a young Edward G. Robinson...",
      "Mayor: Oh!  Thank you.",

      "Bernie: and now, now when I ask you... down on one knee... for a few lousy permits for a tiny little movie!",
      "Mayor: Oh, I'll do it!",
      "Mayor: Ms. Bellum, draw up the permits for Mr. Bernstein.",
      "Bernie: Yeah, can we get some coffee too there, uh, Toots?",
      "Reporter: Yes, folks, right here in our own backyard, our own piece of Hollywood. If you look behind me, you'll see all the cameras and crews setting up for the Powerpuff Girl movie.",

      "Bernie: So, how long have you two been working here at this bank?",
      "Tellers: Um... about seven years.",
      "Bernie: Oh, you're gonna do just fine!  We're gonna need to hire some actors who look like real tellers.",
      "Donnie: Okay, people, cast and crew only. Everybody out!",
      "Guard: Hey, let me know if you need anything.",
      "Bernie: Donnie! We're gonna need a security guard too.",
      "Bernie: This guy stinks.",
      "Reporter: Now if you look behind me, the Powerpuff Girls are just arriving.",
      "Buttercup: That's right! Who's the baddest?",
      "Bernie: Look. I know it's your bank and you're responsible, but we have to use the actual money for reality's sake.",
      "Donnie: Uh, sir, the girls just arrived.",
      "Bernie: Yeah, thank you. Run along now. I'll take full responsibility for the cash myself.",
      "Buttercup: Well, as you know, I'm the toughest.",
      "Bubbles: Yeah, but you're the worst actor.",
      "Bernie: So, what do you think of my girls?",
      "Professor: His girls. Hmph!",
      "Bernie: You know, I've been telling them for years that they have natural talent.",

      "Bubbles: But we did just meet him yesterday, didn't we?",

      "Professor: Listen, buster. I need to see Mr. Bernstein, and I mean now, see?!",
      "Security man 1: Sure thing. Just try his trailer out back.",
      "Professor: Fine!... Thank you.",

      "Donnie: I love how you told them you needed to use the real money for reality's sake!",

      "Bernie: All right, girls, pay close attention, this is how this shot's gonna work. You three'll come in through the breakaway wall right there.",
      "Buttercup: Breakaway?! Ha! We don't need a breakaway wall.",
      "Bernie: Right. So, like I said, you three'll come through the breakaway wall. You'll zip over here, do the little fight thing with the stuntmen here, yadda, yadda, yadda, and then... oh. Donnie! Bring in the Mayor!",
      "Mayor: Hey, I don't even have my script yet!",
      "Donnie: Know what?",
      "Donnie: Don't worry about it.",

      "Blossom: Let them go? Uh... we just can't let them go.",
      "Bernie: Now relax, hon, you're gonna get 'em in the next scene. Trust me, babe, it'll be a long movie.",

      "Donnie: In this next shot, you're gonna play the tellers in the background. The action's gonna take place here in front of you, and the camera will be behind me... there. So just try and act natural, and don't do anything too... distracting. Okay? You're gonna do just fine.",

And I'll arrive at the end with the finishing blow, showing off my awesome physique. Of course, I'll probably have to work out a little and hit the tanning salon, get my gray touched up at the temples...",

Two hundred twelve degrees west of the Greenwich Mean Time on the longitudinal axis, by thirty- two degrees north of the equator on the latitudinal axis, maps a specific point on the globe, that point being right here in the city of Townsville, the intersection of Lincoln and Main, to be exact.

      "Buttercup: This Kick The Moon Man simulator is awesome!",

      "Buttercup: Dude, it's a camp. Let yourself have fun.",
      "Blossom: Having fun is to actually  learn something. I'm gonna find the camp director. I'm sure he'll be very disappointed in seeing people goofing off.",
      "Joey: Did someone say goofing off?  Whoo- hoo! Hey there, kiddo. Welcome to Camp Big Dipper where we have space fun for everyone! I'm Joey, camp director for this space adventure!",

I can't help but say I'm a little disappointed. The way Wendy Q. Dallen talked about it. I thought this place was supposed to be a big step towards scientific advancement, but... It's just full of silly games. They're not even science related.  Ugh, it's so frustrating! I don't see what Dr. Dallen saw in this place. Anyways, I'll talk to you soon, I guess. Love, Blossom.'",
      "Bubbles: Hey, Blossom, why don't you come make arts and crafts with us? I made a rocjet out of paper and glitter.",

      "Buttercup: Okay, we get it! This isn't the camp you expected. That doesn't mean you still can't have fun.",
      "Joey: Did someone say fun? Hey, girls, it's almost time for that big campfire carnival!",
      "Blossom: No thanks, Joey.",
      "Buttercup: Fine, Blossom, stay here and be a jerk. You don't know what you're missing. ",
      "Blossom: Space camp. It's not even real science and... 'Rocket Museum'?  'Closed due to lack of funds/interest.' Hmm. Whoa. This place is incredible!  An Apollo rocket replica?!  I remember from studying all of this. If this was a real rocket, you just press this, and that, and this.",
      "Rocket A.I. Lady: Launch sequence initiated. Takeoff initiated.",

Blossom, flying through the sky. You really wanted more. But now you wonder why. You are Blossom. High above the earth. You're floating in a tin can. You wonder what it's worth. There's a time to learn. Blossom, try to have some fun.",
      "Wendy Q. Dallen: Hello, I'm Dr. Wendy, and you are sitting in an actual rocket ship donated by NASA to Camp Big Dipper. Do you wanna know something? Going to camp was the most important step to becoming who I am today, because I learned that work is important, but our time spent with friends is even more so. So, don't be afraid to be a kid, you only get one chance on it.",
      "Space Rock Joey: Dipper Camp to Captain Bloss. Please change your course, and have some fun! Can you hear me, Captain Bloss? Can you hear me, Captain Bloss?  Do you see that octopus? ",

      "Bubbles: We've been looking everywhere for you.",
      "Blossom: Really?",
      "Buttercup: Yeah. Oh, man, you missed it, dude. There was this rocket and it blasted into space.",
      "Bubbles: And the people saw it coming back to Earth. ",
      "Blossom: Uh... Oh, you don't say. What's that you got there?",
      "Buttercup: Oh, we asked Joey if you had any science e- books we could borrow.",
      "Bubbles: We missed hanging out with you, so we got this book to spend it together. If that's what you want to do. ",
      "Blossom: You guys. That's so sweet.",

      "Buttercup: Please. We're trying to bond here.",
      "Blossom: Actually, I kind of wanted to check out that space octopus ride.",

      "Video Lady: In this unit, we'll be stitching a beautiful country landscape. Follow along using your templates. Everyone, get your needles ready. Start with the pink thread.",
      "Grumpy Teacher: Hear that? Polish your pink thread, people.",
      "Momoko: Uh- oh. Great. Now I'm out of the pink stuff. Hey, Bubbles, can I borrow some of yours?",
      "Miyako: Yeah, sure. I have tons. I always keep extra supplies in my sewing kit.",
      "Momoko: Huh. that's a good idea.",
      "Momoko's Thoughts: The missing part of my shorts.",
      "Momoko: Now we know where you get your extra supplies!",
      "Miyako: Huh?",
      "Kaoru: I'm trying to sew over here. What are you so round up about?",

      "Grumpy Teacher: Be quiet, down the back, if you quiet down and start sewing.",
      "Girls: Yes, ma'am.",
      "Momoko: When class is over, you better have a good explanation for this.",
      "Miyako: But I didn't do it. Why won't you believe me?",
      "Kaoru: You guys are going to get us in trouble. Quit it.",
      "Momoko and Miyako: BUTTERCUP!",
      "Kaoru: What's gotten into you guys today?",
      "Momoko: You greedy little pig.",
      "Miyako: If you wanted some of ours, all you had to do is ask. I would've shared.",
      "Kaoru: What are you talking about?",
      "Momoko and Miyako: Look!",

      "Miyako: And we saw how hungry you were this morning.",
      "Kaoru: So, what? I'm not a thief.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Know- it- alls. All ever Mojo gets to eat is strawed noodles. Oh, now that is what I am talking about. Oh, boy. There are even oranges. Which is my favorite. Finally. I will eat like a king!   Why does this always happen to me?",
      "Mojo Jojo: Is Mojo hallucinating?",
      "Black Spored Him: I have something important to tell you.",
      "Mojo Jojo: You mean like a secret message?",
      "Black Spored Him: Something like that. Right now, the Powerpuff Girls are weak so you can defeat them.",
      "Mojo Jojo: At last! Mojo knew this day would come if he waited long enough. But if you're a stranger, can I trust you?",
      "Mojo Jojo: OK. I trust you. Mojo thinks it's pretty obvious that we both want the same thing: To crush the Powerpuff Girls.",
      "The Girls: Huh?",
      "Professor: The city is in danger once again, girls. Mojo is attacking with one of those awful robot thingies.",
      "Professor: We are all counting on you, girls. Let's go.",
      "The Girls: We're on it.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Good. Here they come.",
      "Kaoru: You just don't know when to quit, do you?",
      "Miyako: Why can't you just be a good little monkey?",
      "Kaoru and Miyako: Huh?",
      "Kaoru: Uh, Blossom, what are you doing?",
      "Momoko: Have you guys ever noticed that I always attack first? That means you and Bubbles get to have the big finale at the time.",
      "Momoko: Maybe you girls should start the battle for once.",
      "Miyako: I think we should talk about this another time.",
      "Kaoru: You're still mad about what at school, aren't you?",
      "Momoko: Well, with you pig, everyone saw my underwear and I never got to eat lunch.",
      "Miyako: It wasn't me.",
      "Kaoru: We don't have time for this. We gotta get Mojo.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Well, it looks like a funny schnitzel, but now it is my chance to strike!",
      "Mojo Jojo: Yes! I have finally done it!",
      "Poochi: No way. He actually caught them.",
      "Kaoru: Blossom, this is all your fault, you know that?",
      "Momoko: Don't blame me. You're the one who ate my lunch.",
      "Professor: They're supposed to fight Mojo, not each other.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Now, first Mojo will send you in for a spin. Now to finish them off. Boom!",
      "Professor: Oh, no.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Did I get them?  Yes, they are gone. I finally defeated the Powerpuff Girls! Now nothing can stop me and I am free to take over the world!",
      "Ken: I sure hope the Girls are alright.",
      "Poochi: If they're not, then we're all in big trouble.",
      "The Mayor: Miss Bellum, do you have those files?",
      "Miss Bellum: Right here, sir.",
      "The Mayor: Oh, no. Help me. You have to call the Powerpuff Girls!",
      "Mojo Jojo: I am sorry, but you will never be mayor ever again.",
      "Mojo Jojo: From now on, I will be the mayor of New Townsville.",
      "The Mayor: You can't just say you're going to be mayor. You have to be elected.",
      "Mojo Jojo: What?",
      "The Mayor: I'm sure we can arrange something.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Mm. That is more like it.",
      "Miss Bellum: I can't work for Mayor Mojo.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Mayor Mojo. Has a nice ring to it. Does it not? Could you do me a favor and say it again one more time, please?",
      "Miss Bellum: Mayor Mojo.",
      "Mojo Jojo: That is like music to my ears. I'll let you stay in honors as my assistant.",
      "Miss Bellum: Thank you, I guess.",
      "The Mayor: Miss Bellum, after all we've been through, how could you do this to me?",
      "Miss Bellum: Sorry, sir, but it is tricky to say no to a monkey with a giant robot. I just work here, remember? I'm not a Powerpuff Girl.",
      "The Mayor: Oh, no. This is terrible!",
      "Mojo Jojo: That is enough talking. You are fired. Good- bye.",
      "The Mayor: Wait. Maybe you need 2 assistants.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Now let us discuss the first order of business.",
      "Miss Bellum: And what would that be?",
      "Mojo Jojo: The most important one. Tell me what we are going to eat for lunch.",
      "Miss Bellum: Sorry. Lunch hour ended a little while ago.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Being a mayor is going to be harder than Mojo thought. Wait. I know something we can do instead.",
      "Professor: You're kidding.",
      "Ken: How could the mayor shut down the science lab? What are we gonna do, Dad?",
      "Mojo Jojo: Now Professor Utonium cannot use his silly inventions to stop me. It is only a matter of time before I take over the world!",
      "Octi/Him: Very good, Mr. Mayor.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Huh? What do you want, little octopus?",
      "Octi/Him: I came to inform you that you are no longer needed.",
      "Mojo's Thoughts: Wait just a sec. He also told me about how the Powerpuff Girls were arguing.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Wait. Mojo is the mayor, so I don't have to listen to you. Where did he go?  You want to be the mayor. OK. We can help you.",
      "The Mayor: If I can't be mayor of New Townsville, what am I supposed to do?",
      "Professor: That's nothing, but with no lab, where am I going to conduct my research? Let's order something to cheer us up.",
      "Ken: Quit complaining, you two. Don't you realize that sitting around here and sulking like babies isn't gonna help anything?",
      "The Mayor: I think he's right, Professor.",
      "Professor: We can't get Mojo out of the mayor's office, but then New Townsville is doomed. Not to mention what would happen if he really does take over the world.",
      "Professor: That's a coincidence. It's Mojo. What happened to you?",
      "Mojo Jojo: I do not know how to say this, but an octopus stole my job.",
      "The Mayor: I don't think anyone expected that.",
      "Mojo Jojo: Are you calling me a liar?",
      "The Mayor: No.",
      "Ken: This octopus monster, can you describe him?",
      "Mojo Jojo: He was wearing his little top hat on his head.",
      "Ken: I wonder what's going on.",
      "Kaoru: What happened?",
      "Miyako: Ken and the Professor must've brought us back to the lab.",
      "Momoko: If they hadn't gotten there, who knows what could've happened to us?",
      "Kaoru: Yeah. I guess Mojo really creamed us back there, didn't he?",
      "Miyako: Hey, what happened to Octi?",
      "Kaoru: Who cares about your stuffed toy? We've got more important things to worry about.",
      "Miyako: What could be more important than my best friend in the world? Because it sure isn't you guys anymore. Not after today. I was looking forward to eating my lunch, you know.",
      "Poochi: There's no time for arguing! The whole city's about to be attacked by a giant octopus monster!",
      "The Girls: Octopus monster?",
      "Miyako: I've got a bad feeling about this.",
      "Momoko: Then let's fix it.",
      "Miss Bellum: I want my old job back!",
      "Miyako: It's my Octi!",
      "Momoko: Yeah, but what happened to him?",
      "Flashback Miyako: OK, Octi. You stay here and look after my room while I'm at school.",
      "Miyako: Why didn't I figure it out before? When I came to school this morning, I left him on my dresser.",
      "Momoko: Are you saying that he jumped on your backpack all by himself?",
      "Kaoru: When I was in the classroom today, he was the only one there. Could that be why he came to school today? What if he was the one who cut the fabric in Blossom's shorts and then ate your lunches?",
      "Momoko: You mean he had us arguing on purpose so Mojo could defeat us?",
      "Octi/Him: I'm impressed. You figured it out.",
      "Kaoru: I know that voice.",
      "The Girls: It's Him.",
      "Him: Very good, girls. Bubbles' little toy was so cute. I just couldn't resist.",
      "Miss Bellum: Hurry. You have to stop him!",
      "Momoko: Don't worry, but that's what we're gonna do. Because we're a team again. Yo- yo octave shot!",
      "Miyako: Bubbles catcher!",
      "Kaoru: Hypersonic...!",
      "Miyako: Wait, Buttercup. Don't do it.",
      "Kaoru: But I have to. He's the bad guy.",
      "Miyako: He's also my little Octi and if you hit him with everything you've got, he might get hurt.",
      "Kaoru: Please tell me you're kidding.",
      "Kaoru: Oh, no.",
      "Miyako: Octi, it's me.",
      "Kaoru: We're coming, Bubbles.",

      "Kaoru: Let her go, Him.",
      "Octi/Him: Fine, then. Say goodbye.",
      "Momoko: No, wait!",
      "Miyako: Huh?",
      "Momoko: We'll do it.",
      "Kaoru: OK.",
      "Miyako: I'm sorry. I have to protect Octi.",
      "Octi/Him: So you see, Powerpuff Girls. After all this time, I finally have the pleasure of winning!",
      "Ken: Boy. The girls are having a very bad day.",
      "Octi/Him: Good. Now everyone can watch me defeat you.",
      "Kaoru: Forget it, Him. You're too weak to defeat us.",
      "Miyako: No, Octi. Don't do this. Fight it. You can go back to being your own self. Back when you were cute and cuddly, and gentle. Remember? As if this is the real you. Oh, Octi.",
      "Him: What is that stuff? It feels like acid.",
      "Miyako: Ahhh. I knew you'd never let mean old Him control you.",
      "Him: You may have won today, but you better watch it because I'll be back.",
      "Him: Hey, you're not listening. At least pay attention to me.",
      "Professor: Of course. Bubbles' tears of pure love with the perfect chemical antidote combat the evil black dust.",
      "Momoko: That was a really dirty trick you pulled.",
      "Miyako: Yeah. You're just a big bully.",
      "Kaoru: Yeah. Let's get him, guys.",
      "Miyako: Bubbles catcher!",

      "Kaoru: Hypersonic Swing!",
      "Him: I'll be someone you didn't see before, but I'll back. You will just see. I will come back.",
      "Miyako: Sorry if I got mad at you today.",
      "Momoko: Yeah. It was all because of Him. We should've known.",
      "Kaoru: Yeah. We'd never do something like that to each other.",
      "Miyako: Yeah. And thanks for helping me protect Octi, you guys.",
      "Poochi: I'm just glad it's over.",
      "The Mayor: I think we need to have a talk about loyalty.",
      "Miss Bellum: You mean about what happened today with Mojo? You think I was working for him on purpose?",
      "The Mayor: It certainly seemed like that to me from where I was standing.",
      "Miss Bellum: Sir, you don't understand. I was only pretending to work for him so I could sabotage his plans. But here, to make up it up to you.",
      "The Mayor: Oh, yes, of course, Miss Bellum. I knew it all along. This is why I put you in charge in the first place.",
      "Miss Bellum: I don't know, sir.",

But you know, I've been all over the world, and there sure is a lot of evil out there. It's too bad there aren't more of you girls out there to help save everybody. Gee, if there was only a way to make more of you girls, we could help save people all over the world... and that would be good, huh?",

But instead, the letter given to those who do most poorly is an F! Seeing as it goes, A, B, C, D, F, with inexplicable skipping of E!

In the unlikely event of any future butt- biting-",

      "Bubbles: Octi?",

      "Bubbles: Where's the rest of you?  Oh, no. This can only mean... you've been mutilated!",

      "Bubbles: Yes.",
      "Professor: Everything okay?",
      "Bubbles: Yes.",

      "Bubbles: Oh, Octi!  I'm going to find whoever did this to you, and they will pay!",
      "Bubbles: Go ahead and laugh! But I know one of you is guilty!  But who? Who would want to kill poor Octi?",
      "Bubbles: Of course!  Buttercup!  She always hated Octi. In fact, I remember one time...",

      "Buttercup: Bubbles! Put down that stupid octopus and help us with this stupid octopus!",
      "Buttercup: Bubbles!",

      "Blossom: Would you stop fooling around and come to bed? I need to get some sleep!",
      "Bubbles: And I need to find Octi.",
      "Blossom: You don't need him. You want him 'cause you're insecure. And as soon as you get over that, you won't think you need him anymore. All you need to do.... is grow up!",
      "Bubbles: I found him!",
      "Blossom: This time... but maybe someday you won't.",

      "Bubbles: No.",
      "Ms. Keane: How do you expect to learn anything if you're always playing with that doll?",
      "Bubbles: Well, but-",
      "Ms. Keane: No buts! Now hand it over.",
      "Ms. Keane: Oh, yes. I try to be extra nice with the girls.",
      "Bubbles: Octi?",
      "Mayor: So, Ms. Bellum, are you enjoying yourself?",

      "Bubbles: He has Octi!",

      "Professor: I wanted to tell you what happened, but I didn't get a chance to. Oh, earlier this evening, when I was cleaning up for the party,",
      "Professor: I was in your room when I accidentally ran over Octi with the vacuum.",
      "Professor: I felt horrible about it, but since no one else had noticed, I decided to take him back to the lab and fix him myself.",
      "Professor: I worked on him for a good 2 hours. And to my surprise, it was a perfect success!",
      "Professor: Well,",
      "Professor: except Octi was missing a leg.",
      "Professor: So I decided to return to the scene of the crime and retrieve the missing leg.",
      "Professor: But when I got back, it was too late.",
      "Professor: And with the party about to start, there was no time left.",
      "Professor: And, well, that's what happened.",
      "Bubbles: So... do you have him?",
      "Professor: Of course I have him.",

      "Bubbles: Can you fix him?",
      "Professor: Of course I can.",
      "Professor: Oh! It doesn't fit!",
      "Bubbles: That's because you've got the leg in backwards. Now try it.",
      "Bubbles: Yippee!  Oh, Octi, I'll never let you out of my sight again! Ever!",
      "Buttercup: But, Professor, then who's on the phone?",
      "Professor: Hello. Who is this?",
      "Mojo Jojo: Sorry to interrupt your little party, but unless you give me 1,000 gallons of Chemical X, Octi dies!  Hello?",
      "Professor: Yeah, ok, hold on.",

      "Blossom: Two options? That's so bilateral! Allow me to take charge.",
      "Professor Utonium: No, Blossom. I want the three of you to work together on this one. Now, I'm going to go run some errands. Oh! And don't worry about this pile. There's some potentially dangerous stuff in there from the lab. I'll go through it on my own. Bye, girls.",
      "Blossom: All right, girls. Let's get...",
      "Buttercup: Whoo!  Check these out!  Old 'Space Towtruck' movies form the 70's! Let's get this fine fast so we can watch'em!",

      "Blossom: Hmph! I guess if you want something done right, you just have to do it yourself. Let's see what I have left... Aha!  Professor said to leave this pile alone. Then again, if he sees how I well organize his stuff, he'll mepake my way the house rule. Besides, he clearly left the flashlight on it. Huh?",

      "Mayor: Well! This visit has been absolutely delightful. Shall we, Ms. Bellum?",
      "Talking Dog: Okay. Now tell me the truth this time. Is that your real hair color?",

      "Thin Staglione: From our legitimate restaurant business, yes.",
      "Agent: So the horrible crime witnessed by the Talking Dog was simply a case of petty littering.",
      "Talking Dog: Petty? It's outrageous! Throwing out perfectly good chewing material?  Oh, the thought!",
      "Bubbles: I guess to a dog, it's just as bad as rubbing someone out.",
      "Agent: Come on, gentlemen. Let's go. You have some small fines to pay.",
      "Fat Staglione: Can you break large bills?",
      "Agent: As usual, girls, thanks for a job well done.",
      "Blossom: You can open your eyes now.",
      "Blossom: It's all over.",

      "Girls: YES!",
      "Talking Dog: Wow. That's great. I mean, that's really fantastic. I can't wait to leave, 'cause... you know, I was just getting attached to you guys. You're like the family I never had.",

Bud, I understand. Heh. After five seasons and a movie, you're probably just tired and feel okay with just phoning it in, right? Heh... What? What? What'd I say?"
