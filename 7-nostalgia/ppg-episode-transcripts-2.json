      "Blossom: Look, Princess. Now do you see why we don't let extra members on our team? Crime-fighting is dangerous business... and you don't really have superpowers or any kind of experience.

      "Blossom: Because you're just a spoiled brat. And being a Powerpuff Girl isn't about getting your way, or having the best stuff, or being popular or powerful. It's about using your own unique abilities to help people and the world we all live in. And you, little girl, have done nothing worthy of the name 'Powerpuff'!",

      "Blossom, Buttercup: YOU'RE TELLING THE WHOLE STORY ALL OVER AGAIN!!!",
      "Bubbles: Sorry.",
      "Mayor: Girls! That's all okey-dokey, peachy keen, and dandy, but you never explained what was so gosh darn funny!",

      "Professor: a race of bug people with a million eyes, 16 legs, exoskeletons, feelers, and—",

      "Blossom: Professor.",
      "Professor: Sorry. But remember, girls. It’s not right to harm an insect just because it’s yucky on the outside. It’s the insect inside that’s important. Now, who wants to touch it?",

      "Professor: Ha, ha, ha! I’ll get a jar.",

      "Professor: Okay, little guy.",

      "Professor: You’re free to go.",

      "Professor: Come on, girls. It’s time for bed.",

      "Narrator: All right, little guy. You heard the Professor. Now scurry on home.",

      "Narrator: Hmm. Something bugs me about that roach. The city of Townsv—Oh. I said that already. Sorry.",

      "Slob: Stupid people. Look at 'em. What incompetent, unorganized, filthy, dirty creatures.",

      "Slob: They’ve been infesting this planet for too long. YOU HEAR ME, PEOPLE? YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED! PREPARE FOR THE COMING OF EARTH’S TRUE MASTERS.",

      "Slob: Skippy! What can you report?",

      "Slob: Yahoo! We must call in the troops.",

      "Slob: HALT!!!!",

      "Slob: In the past, I felt the one thing that might stand in the way of our complete success is those supercharged heroines, the Powerpuff Girls. But thanks to the brave efforts of Cadet Skippy, we are in possession of what I consider the most vital information to the success of our cause. It seems the Powerpuff Girls think you’re icky, gross, disgusting. They’re afraid of you. They won’t touch you. And most importantly, they won’t squish you. And with them doing nothing to stop us, all we gotta do is scurry in and smash those disgusting bipeds, and then together, you and I, Roach Coach, will rule the world!",

      "Narrator: It’s a beautiful day in Townsville.",

      "Man #2: ♫ Hmm, looks good, I’d like to buy a dog ♫",

      "Man #2: ♫ Oh, I shall, oh boy, oh, boy, oh boy ♫",

      "Narrator: Gross, gross, gross! Get them off! Aw, man, this is disgusting! All of Townsville is being infested with roaches!",

      "Mayor: Aah! Aah! Oh, my. Roaches are encroaching on my town!",

      "Mayor: What to do? What to do?",

      "Woman: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor. Don’t you think you should make the call?",
      "Mayor: Oh, yes, yes. Good thinking, Ms. Sara Bellum. Call the exterminator.",

      "Girls: GROSS!!!!",
      "Buttercup: Man, this is disgusting. These bugs got to go.",
      "Blossom: Buttercup, no!",

      "Blossom: Stop! Don’t you remember what the Professor told us? He said, and I quote, “It’s not right to harm an insect just ’cause it’s yucky on the outside. It’s the insect inside that’s important.”",
      "Buttercup: Oh? Like, what are you gonna do, put them in a giant jar?",

      "Buttercup: Hey!",
      "Slob: That’s right, fly away. Fly away scared, you stinking Powerpuffs! Huh?",

      "Narrator: A giant jar? That’s crazy.",

      "Woman: Aah! I’m bug-free!",
      "Narrator: That you are, lady, and so is the rest of the town, so give it up for The Powerpuff Girls! Yes!",

      "Roach Coach: No fair! How dare you trick my army of roaches with a giant jar?",
      "Blossom: So you’re responsible for this mess.",
      "Roach Coach: That I am. I am Roach Coach. I am sick of you human scum infesting the planet! I am here to exterminate!",

      "Blossom: W-W-What’s happening?",

      "Roach Coach: That’s it, boys. Come to papa!",

      "Girls: Uh-oh.",

      "Girls: Not so fast, Roach Coach!",

      "Roach Coach: Annoying Powerpuffs!",

      "Bubbles: Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross.",
      "Buttercup: Please can we squish them now?! Please?!",
      "Blossom: Now, Buttercup, remember, the Professor said not to harm an insect just because it’s yucky on the outside, but… THIS ONE’S YUTCHY ON THE INSIDE!!!!",

      "Roach Coach: Hey! You’re not allowed to harm my roaches!",

      "Roach Coach: Uh-oh.",

      "Roach Coach: AAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!! CURSE YOU, POWERPUFF GIRLS!!!!!!",

      "Blossom: Oh, no! I definitely know it’s not okay to squish a person!",
      "Buttercup: No matter how yucky they are on the inside!",
      "Bubbles: Wait. Look.",

      "Buttercup: Whoa. ",
      "Blossom: He’s a robot.",
      "Bubbles: And look.",

      "Bubbles: There’s an insect inside.",
      "Roach: I am not just an insect, I am Roach Coach! I am the future ruler of this planet, you stupid biped!",
      "Bubbles: Who you calling a biped, you little—",
      "Blossom: Bubbles, no! Don’t squish him! He’s a criminal, and everything has a place in this world, even criminals.",

      "Mayor: Well, girls, thanks again for, Uh…",
      "Ms. Bellum: Saving the day, sir.",
      "Mayor: No, no, no. For saving the day.",
      "Blossom: No problem, Mayor.",

      "Blossom: It’s all in a day’s work. It doesn’t bug us.",

      "Blossom: Professor, you just squished that spider! Oh, I get it. Better safe than sorry, right?",
      "Professor: No. Spiders just creep me out.",

      "Narrator: Oh, Professor. What are we gonna do with you? Ha, ha, ha! Ah.",

      "Narrator: So once again, the day is saved, thanks to the Powerpuff Girls! Ha, ha, ha! “Spiders just creep me out,” he says. Oh, jiminy."
