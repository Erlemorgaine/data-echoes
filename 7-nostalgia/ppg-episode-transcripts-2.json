      "Blossom: Look, Princess. Now do you see why we don't let extra members on our team? Crime-fighting is dangerous business... and you don't really have superpowers or any kind of experience. So you see, it really is for your own safety when I say you just can't be a Powerpuff Girl, all right?",
      "Princess: DAAAAAADDDDDDYYYYYY!!!",

      "Blossom: Because you're just a spoiled brat. And being a Powerpuff Girl isn't about getting your way, or having the best stuff, or being popular or powerful. It's about using your own unique abilities to help people and the world we all live in. And you, little girl, have done nothing worthy of the name 'Powerpuff'!",
      "Buttercup: Ooh, nice bracelets.",
      "Bubbles: Oh, they'll just be smashing with your new prison wardrobe! ",
      "Princess: Why you-you can't do this to me! I'm the Princess! Do you know who my daddy is?  My daddy knows people! And my daddy knows people like money!",

      "Blossom: Would that be five bucks to ride in your limo, or five bucks to be a Powerpuff Girl?",

      "Morbucks: My BFF's, the Powerpuff Girls, are on Townsville Tonight! They're probably gonna mention me and how great I am! Turn it up, Muscle Woman.",
      "Muscle Woman: ",
      "Sophie Golden: As superheroes, what do you girls feel defines a villain?",
      "Blossom: Oh, that's easy. They're selfish.",
      "Morbucks: Oh, definitely.",
      "Buttercup: And greedy.",

      "Morbucks: WHAT?!",
      "Muscle Woman: Hey, they did mention you.",
      "Sophie Golden: Well, there you have it. The Powerpuff Girls keeping Townsville safe and Princess Morbucks is a villain. Up next, can you keep loose bees in your house?  This guy seems to think so.",
      "Morbucks: I... I don't understand.",
      "Muscle Woman: Me neither. Free-range bees is just a recipe for disaster.",
      "Morbucks: No. I mean, the Powerpuff Girls think I'm a... villain?",
      "Muscle Woman: You didn't think that? ",
      "Morbucks: Me? A villain? But I can't be. How can a superhero be a villain?  Everyone likes me. That airplane is loud. They're heroes, so that makes me... a villain?  How do I change this? I have to make things right. There's only one thing to do.",
      "Morbucks: Who's the villain when you're fake superheroes? Knocking down buildings, that makes you a zero, and who's gonna build it all up again? Princess Morbucks and her gold dividends. The Powerpuff Girls are the villains, oh. Uh-uh. Blossom, Bubbles, and the third one's gotta go. Yeah. Real superheroes wear a crown. Kicking them Powerpuff Girls out of town. Money.",
      "Blossom: Destroys buildings? What?",
      "Buttercup: The third one? She doesn't even know my name?",
      "Bubbles: I think it's catchy. ",
      "Jared: I guess you haven't even heard this part. ",
      "Morbucks: Here's another thing about the Powerpuff Brats. Bubbles lies and she doesn't even like cats. ",
      "Bubbles: What? ",
      "Jared: Huh?",
      "Bubbles: I DO LIKE KITTIES! ",
      "Buttercup: It's okay, Bubbs. No one is gonna watch this dumb video, anyway.",

      "Buttercup: My name is Buttercup.",
      "Morbucks: Is it? Well, whatever. According to you, I'm just a villain. ",
      "Blossom: Wait. So you don't think you're a villain?",
      "Morbucks: You don't think that you're a villain? Someone's been getting her facts wrong again.",
      "Blossom: I never get my facts wrong.",
      "Barry: Not according to this slamming jam!",
      "Morbucks: Blossom pretends she knows the facts, but in reality, smarts is what she lacks. ",
      "Blossom: Facts don't meow.",
      "Barry: Says you. ",
      "Morbucks: Anyways, I have to go. I have a big sold-out concert tonight. ",
      "Bubbles: I do like kitties!  I love kitties! Hmph!   ",
      "Buttercup: I know, Bubbs, I know.",
      "Blossom: Don't worry, girls, this is just Morbucks being Morbucks. That song will blow over by the end of the day.",
      "Bob: I tell you, a bad song keeps on getting more popular.",
      "Nick: Yes. it does, Bob. Stay tuned for for Townsville Tonight featuring Princess Morbucks, superhero and singer, up the platinum track, Easy To Be Good Cuz The Powerpuff Girls Are So Bad. And in other news, Mojo Jojo robbed two banks today.",
      "Bob: What a shame, Nick.",
      "Blossom: Mojo Jojo robs two banks and they don't even call us?",
      "Buttercup: Time to serve up some violence. ",
      "Professor: I don't think so, young lady! Now get your butt out of town!  I'm sorry, girls, it's the song. It's just so catchy. ",
      "Blossom: Catchy? Hmm.",
      "Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup: Morbucks is a meanie. She must've gotten up on the wrong side of the bed. Her hair is puffy. It's puffy hair. It's on top of her body. ",
      "Blossom: Ew!",
      "Buttercup: At least I looked good.",
      "Bubbles: I think I can work with this. ",
      "Morbucks: Hello, Townsville!   Thank you, thank you! Be sure to check out my new album: Rumors: About The Powerpuff Girls That Are All True. What the...?",
      "Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup: We're Powerpuff Girls. But we are really nice. Superhero girlfriends. Keeping you safe every day and every night. Flying way up in the sky. But not before we rebuild your buildings. Let us stay in Townsville.",

      "Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup: We're really great. Let us stay.",
      "Barry: I feel like the Powerpuff Girls should stay here in Townsville.",

      "Buttercup: Townsville's back on our side, baby!",
      "Bubbles: And we didn't have to say one bad thing about you.",
      "Morbucks: Fine! Everyone thinks I'm a villain? I'll show you a villain!  It's time to knock you off the charts. With this! My indestructible music mech!",
      "Bubbles: Did she plan that?",
      "Morbucks: I think it's time to drop the mic!  Hey, would a villain do this?   Or this?  Take that, Townsville! You miserable losers! And this!  And this!  And this!  And this! ",
      "Blossom: Girls, let's give Morbucks a hot mic! ",

      "Bubbles: Did we just help the Fashionistas rob people? Oh, no! We've become too helpful!",
      "Blossom: I don't think we... meant to help them, Bubbles. I think it was that perfume! Smelling it must temporarily hypnotize people to do their bidding!",
      "Buttercup: Ah, great. What do we do now? Cut of our noses?",
      "Buttercup: But my face will look terrible without one!",

      "Bianca: Yes, but they'll look even better on us!",

      "Blossom: Stop right there, Fasionistas!",
      "Buttercup: And don't even think about trying to spray us with that nasty perfume, cause we got nose plugs, so we can't smell nothing!",
      "Bubbles: And I put nose plugs in my ears too, so I can't hear anything!",
      "Blossom: Bubbles, you didn't need to do that.",
      "Bubbles: Yes! I do like cats!",
      "Bianca: Looks like we can't stop the Tackypuff girls with our perfume, but I bet they can!",

      "Crowd: Yeah!",
      "Announcer: Dateline Townsville! This just in: The Fasionistas are headed towards townsville in their fasionable blimp, the Bikini Bomber. Apparentely it is loaded with their signiture scent, Worship. Rumor has it they're going to spray our citizens, turning them into slaves of fashion forever. When reached for comment, the Fasionistas said, 'Mua-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha--ha. Ha.",
      "Buttercup: This is the worst day ever!",
      "Bubbles: Worse than the time we fought the sludgebeast at the vomitorium?",
      "Buttercup: Hmm. Okay. Second worst day ever.",
      "Blossom: There must be some way to neutralize that perfume! We need help!"
